    "content": "SQL (Structured Query Language): SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS) or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).\n\nDate and Timestamp Data Manipulation: Date and timestamp data manipulation in SQL involves performing operations on date and time values stored in a database table. This includes tasks such as extracting specific components of date/time values, formatting dates, performing calculations, and comparing date/time values.\n\nTech Screens: Tech screens are a common step in the recruitment process for technical roles, where candidates are assessed on their technical skills and knowledge usually through a series of tests or interviews. These screens often focus on evaluating a candidate's proficiency in coding, problem-solving, and domain-specific skills.\n\nData Wrangling: Data wrangling refers to the process of cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data into a desired format for better decision-making or analysis. This process often involves tasks such as transforming data types, handling missing values, filtering, merging datasets, and aggregating data.\n\nDatabase Manipulation: Database manipulation involves performing operations on a database, such as querying data, inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting records. It also includes tasks related to creating and managing database structures like tables, indexes, and views.\n\nHR Phone Screen: An HR phone screen is an initial screening interview conducted by a Human Resources (HR) representative to assess a candidate's qualifications, fit for the role, and overall soft skills. It serves as a prelude to further interviews in the hiring process.\n\nProduct Data Science: Product data science is a specialized field within data science that focuses on leveraging data to optimize and enhance products, features, or services offered by a company. Product data scientists analyze user behavior, conduct A/B testing, and develop predictive models to improve products based on user insights.\n\nSQL Study Plan: An SQL study plan is a structured approach to learning and mastering SQL concepts, syntax, and query optimization techniques. It usually includes reviewing basic SQL syntax, practicing with intermediate and advanced problems, and focusing on specific topics like date and timestamp manipulation.\n\nPython: Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various domains, including data science, web development, automation, and machine learning. Python is popular for its rich ecosystem of libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.\n\nPandas: Pandas is a Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series to efficiently work with structured data, perform data wrangling tasks, and conduct data exploration. Pandas is commonly used in data science and analytics projects."
