-Can you see me by the way? Uh, yeah.
-Okay, good. 'Cause I just was wondering,
'cause I under-- Didn't you just
get Lasik surgery? -I did.
How do you know that? [ Laughter ] -You got Lasik surgery,
which is a major surgery. -It i--
Yeah, but, um... [ Laughter ] I did, but I don't --
I don't even tell people that. -But you can see me perfect?
I just want to make sure, yeah. -No, it was great.
I really can see very well. -Do you take painkillers or
anything when you do that stuff? [ Laughter ] Well, I mean, do they give you
like laughing gas or something? -They definitely give you
some pretty hard-core pills after you...
-Yeah. -...have a laser in your eye.
What is going on? [ Laughter ] -So you're saying --
So, post-surgery, you're a little loopy?
You know? You have things on your eyes?
And -- -What's happening right now? [ Laughter ]
[ Drumroll ] -Your mom may or may not have
videotaped you after surgery. [ Audience "Oohs," applause ] [ Laughter ] And she gave us the video. [ Laughter and applause ] -For the television? -Wait.
This is a world premiere. You got to check this out. [ Drumroll ]
[ Cheers ] This is Taylor Swift,
post-surgery. You were, like,
freaking out over a banana. [ Laughter ] Anyway, here's Taylor at home
after her Lasik surgery. Video taken by her mom.
Take a look at this. This is real. -Okay, so, she found --
she found a snack. -That wasn't the one I wanted. [ Laughter ] -Stop, you can't cry. That's not supposed to be
what you're doing. -I tried to get this one. -Okay, I'm gonna
get the other one for you. Okay. -I wanted this one,
but what do we do with this now? -I'll eat it.
I'll eat it. It's mine.
-But it doesn't have a head. -Honey, it's fine.
I don't need a head. -Okay. I'm crying.
I'm fine. -Don't --
You don't want to cry. That's not what you want to do. -Sometimes it doesn't
go your way. [ Laughter ] -Don't fall asleep
eating a banana, okay? -I'm not asleep. My mind is alive. -Okay. [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ -Don't be mad.
Don't be mad. Don't be mad at me.
Don't be mad at me. I made some calls. -Oh, my God!
-I may have made some calls. -That's on television.
-Me and your mom -- [ Laughter ] You goes,
"This one doesn't have a head. What are we gonna do with it?"
[ Laughter ] Me and your mom stayed in touch.
-Wait. She was kind enough
to drive me there but cruel enough to film it
and give it to you? [ Laughter ]
-Yes, that's what -- That's what a good mom does.
-Ugh! -I love you, Mom! That's what a good mom does. -I was --
You notice the -- I had these goggles on,
which are really high fashion. But then they had
to tape it to my head. -Yeah, and you're
not allowed to cry. And just -- Oh.
The whole thing was so funny. -But I was crying, I think,
over a banana. [ Laughter ] -Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my God. -Anyways, tell your mom
thanks again for that. -Oh.
-She's the best. -You know what?
I'm gonna tell her something. [ Laughter ] -Let's talk
"Saturday Night Live." You're on "SNL." You're great
on "Saturday Night Live." And you're good at live. Last time I saw you was
at the "Time 100" -- -I'm sorry. I can't think
about anything else. [ Laughter ]
I had like -- -Dude, it's my favorite. We watched it in the office
like 20 times today. I'm like, "Oh, my God."
[ Laughter ] "This is not real. I can't
believe we have this footage." You're like, going like,
"But this is the wrong one. I wanted the other one." You're like, "What do we do
with this banana?" And she's like,
"We'll take care of it." You go,
"But this doesn't have a --" -"But its head is gone!"
[ Laughter ] -"It doesn't have a head."
Oh, my gosh. It just was so cute.
It made me laugh. -Well, okay.
So, I was at a party, like, a couple months ago,
and I had like 2 1/2 mojitos. And then the next day, drunk -- #DrunkTaylor was like
number-one trending on Twitter. -Yeah, I saw that. [ Cheers and applause ] -Because, you know,
I go, like, from zero to legitimately thinking I'm
a wizard within like two drinks. [ Laughter ] -"I'm a wizard." Yeah.
-Like, really thinking like -- -You were fun, though. You were dancing around doing --
you're dancing -- -Yeah, but thinking about
the fact that that went as far as it did, and then
we've got this happening... [ Laughter ] -This would be -- This is Lasik.
-...that you've done this now. -This is Lasik lover.
#LasikLover. [ Laughter ] #LasikLover.
Um, "SNL" -- -I can't even be mad. I'm just impressed
that you infiltrated my family. [ Laughter ] I don't even know
how you did that. Nobody has my mom's number.
Like, how did -- -Yeah, I asked
for your mom's number. But, yeah,
we've been friends for years. -Oh, well, you know,
news to me. This is great.
[ Laughter ] -What -- What songs
are you doing on "SNL"? Can you say?
Have you said? -Yeah, I'm fine with saying.
-You can? -I mean, I'll tell --
Well, you know, we gotta be a little cryptic,
just 'cause it's fun. But I'll probably do "Lover."
-Want to point at them? Ooh.
-I'll do "Lover," but in a way that I haven't performed it
before, which -- [ Cheers and applause ] And then I'm gonna do a song
that I have never performed before at all, live.
-Wow. -So...
-That's a scoop! I'll take that scoop. Taylor Swift, everybody.
