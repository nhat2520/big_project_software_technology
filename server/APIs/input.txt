British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced plans to crack down on what he has labelled Britain's "sick note culture". The leader believes there are too many people in the UK claiming welfare benefits because of mental health issues. He said welfare payments were a drain on the economy, and the number of people not working was creating labour shortages.
