    "content": "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). Here are some key terms related to SQL mentioned in the text:\n\n1. Date and Timestamp Data Manipulation: The process of effectively handling and manipulating date and time data within SQL databases to perform operations such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating temporal information.\n\n2. Tech Screens: Technical screening is a common practice in the hiring process for tech-related roles, involving evaluating candidates' technical skills and expertise, often through interviews or assessments.\n\n3. Data Wrangling: Data wrangling refers to the process of transforming and cleaning raw data into a structured format for easier analysis and interpretation, commonly done in preparation for database manipulation and analysis tasks.\n\n4. Database Manipulation: Database manipulation involves performing operations on databases, such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data, to retrieve and manage information stored in a structured manner.\n\n5. HR Phone Screen: An initial screening process conducted by Human Resources departments to assess a candidate's suitability for a job role, often involving discussions on experience, role fit, salary expectations, and next steps in the hiring process.\n\n6. Product Data Science: A specialized role within data science that focuses on leveraging data to optimize and enhance products, features, or services offered by a company, involving tasks like user behavior analysis, AB testing, and predictive modeling.\n\n7. Python: A high-level, versatile programming language used extensively in data analysis, machine learning, web development, and various other domains, commonly employed in tech screening for tasks related to data manipulation and analysis.\n\n8. SQL Study Plan: A structured plan for learning and mastering SQL concepts, starting from basic syntax and progressing to advanced functions like window functions, common table expressions (CTE), and subqueries, with a focus on effective manipulation of date and timestamp data.\n\n9. Window Functions: Advanced SQL functions that operate on a set of rows related to the current row, facilitating complex data analysis and aggregation tasks within queries, commonly used in scenarios involving ranking, partitioning, and filtering data.\n\n10. LeetCode: An online platform offering coding challenges and problems across various programming languages, including SQL, for practicing and improving technical skills, commonly used by individuals preparing for tech interviews.\n\nThese terms provide a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and tools mentioned in the text related to SQL, data science, programming languages like Python, and the interview process in tech-related fields."
