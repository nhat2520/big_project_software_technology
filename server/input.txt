but if you need a little refresher here is my SQL study plan understand how to manipulate date and timestamp data effectively my experience with python Tech screens mainly revolve around data wrangling and database manipulation so I have have some updates two companies reached out and they wanted to have the HR phone screen so I scheduled one for today and one for tomorrow the HR phone screen is pretty typical it's just one way for them to know that I'm a real person have a conversation with me two is for them to gauge if I'm the right candidate for this role three is for me to gauge if this role is what I'm looking for if it's the right fit for me and four we will probably graze very briefly around salary expectations that's really important for any job and then lastly we'll go over next steps for the interview process if we both feel like it's a good fit I remember at the start of my career I used to be so nervous for these HR phone screens because I'm like what if they don't like me what if they don't move me forward I think what's changed is these days I know exactly the kind of role that I want I know what skills I want to develop with my next role I know my salary goals with all of that it just puts me in a position of power and it gives me a lot of confidence to lead the conversations the tech recruiting cycle is so freaking long I've personally been in interview Loops where I had six to eight interviews in total and it spanned over 4 to 6 weeks before I even heard back about a decision that process repeats for every single company that you decide to interview for so make sure that you like the role make sure that all of the expectations are set at the get-go and you're happy with that before you invest all of your time and energy into interviewing with them hello hi yes I'm good how are you yes I'm based in New York how about you yeah of course so my name is Julia I worked at Spotify I was there for almost 5 years and my expertise is in experimentation and driving Insight proven features to Market yeah yeah that sounds great so you can pick any chain that you like and then up to three charms we do these like the little half Parts yeah I love that so each of you got one hello look who decided to show up everybody have friendship RAC you guys are adorable I love it well this one's going to be forever yeah you can't have I'm going to have it on this arm then so this one deeper I takee [Applause] good morning today we are getting some studying done I am not going outside today I'm just going to sit myself at the seat and study so both of the HR phone calls went well and the next step in the interview process is the text screen I mentioned this previously but I'm only applying to product data science roles product data science is a specialized role within the field of data science that leverages data to optimize and enhance certain products or features or services offered by a company some things that we do include analyze user Behavior perform AB testing and develop predictive models to improve products or use user Behavior if you want to learn more about my day-to-day as a product data scientist at my old role I have a bunch of videos on that I also found a great medium article that gives a holistic view of what product data science does and all the different aspects of our work and who we work with so I will link that down below as well I preface all of this because obviously the kind of role you apply for reflects the kind of interviews that you get and the kind of technical questions that you get so as a product data scientist I've only ever gotten questions that were python or SQL based I thought for today's study session we can take things nice and slow and we can start off with the basics of SQL I used SQL every single day at work so I didn't need to spend too much time reviewing but if you need a little refresher here is my SQL study plan review the basics understand fundamental syntax like select from where Group by having order by and the different types of joins in their applications tackle intermediate problems practice using aggregate fun FS such as count sum mmax average and techniques like case statements and working with distinct values Master Advanced functions this includes all the window functions CTE and subqueries it's also really important that you understand how to manipulate date and timestamp data effectively I don't think the use cases or questions asked for SQL diverge that much and I never had a SQL text screen that didn't touch upon window functions or edge cases that involved date and time stamps so it's crucial to have a solid grasp of these concepts for these first three steps I highly recommend mode analytics SQL tutorial it effectively caters to both beginners and season SQL users by providing comprehensive explanations and exercises what's great is that it comes with a query editor allowing you to practice and validate your understanding in real time the material is completely free to access but if you want to use the query editor which is also free you just have to sign up for an account when you feel like you have a good grasp of the language it's time to practice practice practice I personally like to use Le code for practice problems currently I'm working through their SQL 50 study plan which includes 50 basic to intermediate SQL questions I try to do five a day but you can take it at your own pace if you really want to challenge yourself and think these questions are a tad bit too easy I love Emma dang's article on window functions she not only provides insightful explanations through her YouTube video but also offers a list of advanced practice problems to really help you refine your sequel skills the free version of leak code has its limit ation and although you can still draw a lot of value from it I personally have the subscription just note that none of the tools or websites I've mentioned are sponsored they're platforms I've personally relied on for my own learning and growth and I'm sharing them with you all because I believe in their effectiveness and value [Applause] soup first very good my mom would be proud ASD and Miu sent over some jewelry pieces they also invited me to their store earlier this week and I got three charms the first one is this Scorpio sign this one is my birth month sign I think it's like Citron or Citrus and this one is I don't know if you can see it but it's half a heart and Yan has the other half oh their packaging is so cute this is a necklace I really only wear thin necklaces so I'm really excited to style something more bold and chunky oo I don't I don't know if you can tell but it's a little warped so it is a little twist on the classic hoop earring which I love last piece wait I love that this pair is like bold yet minimal at the same time I'm going to wear these today so cute okay quick outfit of the day trousers are from W concept they're pinstriped not sure if you can tell through the camera the jacket is from C button down is from uniel and today we're just going to head over to a coffee shop to do some more studying my experience with python Tech screens mainly revolve around data wrangling and database manipulation I rarely encounter data structure or algorithm style coding questions with that being said though I will still go through some leak code easy questions and try to answer them in Python because I believe it's crucial to maintain a strong grasp of python fundamentals my library of choice for data wrangling is pandas and kackle offers an excellent free quick course to refresh your skills in data manipulation with pandas they provide exercises that you can run using their notebooks as well and additionally kagle offers access to numerous public data sets and notebooks another resource I love is this GitHub repo filled with panda exercises it's split up into different chapters with Solutions and even includes video walkthroughs even though I used pandas and python frequently at work walking through this repo has been immensely helpful
